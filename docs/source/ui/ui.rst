User Interface
==============

A preliminary user interface for trump is being prototyped.

It was born out of Flask, Jinja2 and Bootstrap "hello world".

Some screen shots, of the beginning, are below.
   
.. figure:: ui-symbol-browser.png

   (For now) all symbols available are listed alphabetically to the left.
   Symbols can be searched by name, tags, meta, and description.  

.. figure:: ui-symbol-example.png

   An example of symbol page, for a symbol with two feeds.  

.. figure:: ui-menu.png

   Some of the menus, are starting to take shape.  One can generate a plot, or download data to excel.
